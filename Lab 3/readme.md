# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab

# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* What is the difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive?

  Latency is the Seeked time which is measured that defines the amount of time it takes a hard drive's read / write head to find the physical location of a piece of data on the disk. The Disk transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency. 

* How a solid state (SSD) hard drive is different from a traditional hard drive?

  An SSD is a storage device that uses solid state memory to store data. Traditional hard drive is much slower then an SSD.

* Why does increasing RAM make the computer run faster?

  The More RAM you have in your computer, the increase of speed memory transfers information to other components.

* What is the difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths?

  A 64 bit data path is a more newer system. A 32 bit tend to have older processors. 

## ALU and Control Unit
* Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU

  The ALU works arithmetic and logic operations and the control unit determines the organization of the operations.

## CPU, Input and Output
* Identify how the example addresses each of the components: CPU, Input and Output



# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers 

  Decimal uses base-ten, binary uses base-two and hexadecimal uses base-sixteen.

* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work (be sure to include your name in your screenshot or scanned file)

  11010011

* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work)

  362

* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work)

  192

# Conclusion
Reflect on what you have learnt from this week
This week I have learned how to convert Decimal to Binary, Binary to decimal and decimal to hexadecimal. I learned more about RAM and what it does and how increasing it helps the speed of your computer.
