# Executive Summary
Summarize this assignment and the goal of this lab
The goal of this assignment is to be able to understand hexadecimal color representation and Logic Gates and Circuits
## Hexadecimal color representation
* Explain the representation: #ab00ff using the site: https://www.colorhexa.com/ 
The representation of #ab00ff shows it's RGB values. It represents R:171, G:0, B:255 and CMYK values of C:0.33, M:1, Y:0, K:0.
* When considering accessibility in web sites would this color be problematic? Explain what should be considered. 
This would not be problematic as it is color blind user friendly
## Logic Gates and circuits
* Explain what is meant by a truth table and apply your knowledge to a NAND gate. 
 A truth table in a NAND gate tells you that if the input is 0 the output will be 1
* How does the NAND gate truth table compare to that of an AND gate? 
A NAND gate operates while an AND gate is not followed by a NOT gate
* Complete the logic gate exercises word doc and upload to this folder.

## IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
* Explain the purpose of IEEE and the importance of ethics in device design
The purpose of IEEE is to work solely towards innovating and educating the electrical and electronic development industry. The ethics keep your work very honest and clean.
# Conclusion
Explain what you learnt from this lab
I have learned the purpose of IEEE and Hexadecimal color representations
